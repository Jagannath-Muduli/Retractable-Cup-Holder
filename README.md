## Tools & Technologies

CATIA – 3D modeling and assembly design

Bambu Studio – 3D printing preparation (slicing, scaling, supports)

3D Printer: Bambu Lab

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and prototyping a retractable cup holder that can securely hold various cup sizes while being compact and foldable when not in use. The main goal was to create a space-saving and user-friendly design suitable for vehicles, desks, or furniture.

The prototype demonstrates how simple mechanisms can improve usability and ergonomics in everyday products.

## Design Process

Concept Sketching

Brainstormed ideas for a compact, retractable design with easy fold-and-slide motion.

## 3D Modeling in CATIA

Created detailed part models for the base frame, arms, and sliding mechanism.

Assembled components and checked for alignment and motion constraints.

## File Conversion

Exported the final assembly as an STL file for 3D printing.

3D Printing using Bambu Studio

Imported the STL model, adjusted the scale, supports, and material infill, and generated the G-code.

Printed the prototype using PLA filament on a Bambu Lab 3D printer.

Testing & Evaluation

Checked the folding and unfolding motion, stability, and fit of the printed parts.

Observed the design’s strength and usability under practical use.

## Key Features

Retractable and Foldable: Saves space when not in use.

Customizable Design: Can fit different cup diameters.

Ergonomic Operation: Smooth sliding and easy access.

Lightweight Prototype: 3D printed using PLA material.

## Learning Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience with 3D modeling and assembly in CATIA.

Learned to convert models to STL and prepare them for 3D printing.

Understood the importance of tolerances and material selection in physical prototyping.
